## run_dmv.sh -- Run DMV in GPU systems.
##
## This is an example script for submitting to the Torque system your
## experiments. You can freely change the script as you like. Please respect the
## `walltime' attribute. The full experiments set won't take more than 4 hours.
##
## Please remember to compile your code with `make DEBUG=0' before
## submitting. If you plan to use this script, we recommend you to enable only
## the GPU kernels to avoid unnecessary executions of the serial and OpenMP
## version of the code wasting your time. Use similar scripts with just the
## required executions for these versions.
